\subsection{Selection criteria}
To make a well-founded choice in the concept generation phase. Several factors are taken into account each with there own level of importance. The design consideration are listed below: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Accuracy: The ability to reach the requirements of the stroke and repeat ability.
    \item Complexity: The complexity of the design on construction or/and control system. 
    \item Size: The requirements on the size of the machine should be met, as well as the weight of the system.
    \item Parasitic error: Unwanted movements in other direction than the actuated degree of freedom, which in term result in a lower accuracy.
    \item Velocity: Ability to meet the required velocity 
    
\end{itemize}
